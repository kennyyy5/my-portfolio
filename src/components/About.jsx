        I’m a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph 
        set to graduate spring 2028 with a strong interest in software and web development.</p>
        <p>
         I have experience in languages like C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and SQL/NoSQL and have built
          projects such as a real-time chat app using MERN an NoSQL and a chatbot using APIs and RAG technology. 
          I've also analysed and predicted data using Python librabries e.g. NumPy, Panadas and TensorFlow.
          </p>
          <p>
          I've also gained experience in mobile development by building a weather app using React
           Native and a social media app, habit tracker, and music player using Flutter. 
           As a detail-oriented person, I’m always eager to learn new technologies. 
           </p>
           <p>
           I’m also a peer helper, which has developed my leadership, communication,
            and teamwork skills. With a focus on adaptability and problem-solving, 
            I’m confident my collaborative work ethic and skills would be an asset to your team.
